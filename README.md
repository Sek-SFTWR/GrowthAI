# Student Grade Prediction AI System

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based system designed to predict student grades using deep learning models. The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, implemented in **Keras**, for accurate prediction. The model is integrated with a **Flask** web framework to create a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

The primary goal of this system is to predict a student's future academic performance based on historical data, such as past grades, course attendance, and other relevant features. It is built to assist educators and institutions in identifying students who may require additional support and intervention.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN model built with Keras for grade prediction based on various input features such as assignments, test scores, and attendance records.
- **Flask Integration**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for inputting student data and receiving grade predictions.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Users can input student data (e.g., past grades, participation) and receive grade predictions immediately.
- **Data Processing**: The system preprocesses data to handle missing values and normalize input features for improved model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: The system provides visual feedback on model accuracy and predictions to enhance interpretability.

## Technologies Used
- **Keras**: A deep learning framework for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras to handle the training and deployment of the model.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework used to create the API and frontend interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface to interact with the Flask backend.
- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing machine learning models and the Flask server.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The system uses historical student data, which may include past grades, attendance, extracurricular activities, and demographic information.
2. **Model Training**: A CNN model is trained on the collected data to recognize patterns and predict future student performance.
3. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it can be deployed on a Flask server. The user enters relevant student data, and the system predicts the student's future grade.
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
